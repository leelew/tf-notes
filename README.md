## Introduction
This folder contains the code and notes for learning TensorFlow V2.0, it divided into four parts: /variables, /functions, /autograph, /dataset. You will get the drift of how to use TensorFlow V2.0, and the difference between TensorFlow V1.0 with V2.0.

1. [Variables](): Build different type variables (e.g., variables, constant, string, sparse variables etc.)
2. [functions](): Construct your own DL & ML model using loss func, dense layers, activation layers & diff-calculate method. Also, you can integrate these methods with **Keras** to get a more robust model.
3. [autograph](): Learn the difference of **graph mode** and **eager mode**. 
4. [dataset](): Learn how to construct & save dataset used for TensorFlow V2.0.
